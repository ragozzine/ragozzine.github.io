Project management requires much asking  
Of clients and coders for more info  
So that a PM can get to tasking  
in Basecamp, Jira, or maybe Trello.  
But before productive action can start  
five basic questions need some addressing.  
These _W_ queries allow the heart  
of a project to beat without stressing.

When newspapers report on the here’n now  
All are asked the Five: _who, what, when, where, why_  
(Plus the anti-alliterative _how_)  
To separate truth from black-hearted lie.  
These words can help PM pre-production  
workflows work without any obstruction.  

## Who/What
Who is requesting the task to be done?  
Hopefully one with authorizing writ.  
Nothing’s worse than delivering a ton  
of code your main stakeholder ne’er green-lit.  
But approved work needs timely assigning  
by the PM, who does the budget checks,  
to a single assignee, defining  
who will do what; What’s what we’ll ask for next.  
What needs to be done is estimated.  
Both effort and outcome identified  
We get on the same page by what’s stated  
The approval process is also eyed.  
With the who and the what firmly nailed down  
PMs can move on to When-n-where Town.  

## When/Where
Slotting in work depends when it is due,  
But also when can we start on our code?  
The budget might not allow immediate action,  
So know when to begin and when to be done.  
And since we don’t code like cowboys risking,  
When can this work be sent to production?  
And where is production code sent whisking?  
Where will staging code endure construction?  
And there are more wheres that need to be known,  
Like where will we track task conversation  
And where to track time as efforts are sown.  
(Untracked time causes PM frustration.)  
With all aforementioned finally filed,  
Seek out the tamers of projects most wild.  

## Why/How
Because it was there, Mallory labored  
Summiting peaks as if they were hillsides  
But change for change’s sake is like a jaybird  
Spinning through space on a whimsy joyride.  
Why work is sought out is crucial to find;  
The code must target an issue to thrive.  
Issues mean metrics to keep top of mind  
To suss out success once code work goes live.  
Lastly is how, as in _How is this solved?_  
Let your dev team handle all this thinking  
After, you should understand what’s resolved;  
Give space at first for solution linking.  
Your workflow will flourish when firstly fed  
these basic questions, John metrically said.
